# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company hosting several thousand employees. As their older employees are beginning to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett-Hackard is looking towards the future in two ways. First, they are offering retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria. Second, they are looking at which department's headcount will be impacted the most by this forthcoming wave of retirement. I am helping their HR analyst create an employee database with SQL by applying my data modeling, engineering, and analysis skills.

## Results
After helping the HR analyst create an employee database, I was able to sort the data for the employees retiring, their position, and their department. Additionally, the company decided to start a mentorship program for near-retirement employees to mentor a less senior employee before they retire.

Four major points from this analysis are highlighted below:

### How Many Employees are Retiring
Over 90,000 employees are eligible for retirement out of 300,000 total employees.That's 30% of employees!

### Positions with Highest Vacancy Potential


### Pewlett-Hackard Hiring Strategy

### Who is Eligible to be a Mentor
