# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company hosting several thousand employees. As their older employees are beginning to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett-Hackard is looking towards the future in two ways. First, they are offering retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria. Second, they are looking at which department's headcount will be impacted the most by this forthcoming wave of retirement. I am helping their HR analyst create an employee database with SQL in order to shed light on this upcoming retirement and help Pewlett-Hackard create a retiring and hiring plan.

## Results
After helping the HR analyst create an employee database, I was able to sort the data for the employees retiring, their position, and their department. 

Four major points from this analysis are highlighted below:

### How Many Employees are Retiring
Over 90,000 employees are eligible for retirement out of 300,000 total employees.That's 30% of employees!

### Positions with Highest Vacancy Potential
To no surprise, senior positions face the highest vacancy potential as seen in the image below. Something worth noting is that there are many employees generally labeled as 'Staff', which limits our analysis of titles retiring.

### Pewlett-Hackard Hiring Strategy
Considering that many of the upcoming vacancies are for senior positions, Hewlett-Packard really needs to think about it's hiring startegy. First, they will need to determine which departments to make priority, but more importantly, they need to decide if they want to fill these positions with existing employees or seek outside candidates. 

Pewlett-Hackard decided to start a mentorship program for near-retirement employees to mentor a less senior employee before they retire. The mentoring program seems like a good way to train existing employees to take on more responsibility at the firm and fill the vacant roles. Therefore, I recommend inside hires for the senior vacant positions, then seeking outside candidates for lower-level roles.

### Who is Eligible to be a Mentee
Through this analysis, the specification of who is eligible to be a mentor and a mentee is a bit unclear. The only criteria given to find eligible mentee was that they must be born in the year 1965, but this does not account for other factors that could make someone a great mentee fit, such as position. With this eligibility requirement, it appears about only 1,500 current employees are eligible to be a mentee in the mentorship program.

## Summary
If all employees eligible for retirement choose to leave, there will be over 90,000 open roles. There are more than enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

Suggestions to take this analysis further includes creating a table for current employees in each department to compare against retirees by department. Additionally, it could be interesting to survey employees eligible for retirement to discover what percentage actually plan on leaving in the near-term in order to refine Hewlett-Packard's future hiring plans.
